        <h2>Team 4: Hollywood Fitness Project Plan</h2>

		<p>Thank you for giving us the opportunity for the redesign of the Hollywood Fitness website. Working together, we believe that we can create a website that is easy to navigate and has a professional and enticing design. Based on your replies with the original questions we had sent you, we have identified and listed below the Problems and Solutions that we will want to address in this project.</p>

		<h3>Problems</h3>

		<p>Hollywood Fitness needs a redesign to better reach out to the community and to also serve and support the current Hollywood Fitness members. Furthermore, the Hollywood Fitness website needs to be inspiring and full of excitement about what is going on inside and outside the gym. Hollywood Fitness needs a rewards program that requires participation from its members. The Hollywood Fitness website needs some redesigning, such as getting rid of drop down menus and better call to actions. </p>

		<h3>Solutions</h3>

		<p>We will provide Hollywood with a fresh new web design that is easy to navigate and provides useful information to current members and is enticing enough to draw in new members. The design will also convey to potential members that Hollywood Fitness is a professional, fun, and local gym.</p>
		
		<p>The design will integrate the current logo and color palette so it will maintain a familiar look to current members, but will at the same time show them that Hollywood Fitness is improving its web presence in order to serve them better.</p>

		<p>The website will be built on WordPress, and would follow all best web practices. The website would no longer have drop down menus, but would have a list of options once the user clicked on the specific page.</p>

		<p>The homepage would have a slider with a hero image that has a short description with a video link that would be a clear call to action saying "Watch Video". The video would be talking about the gym and discussing what sets Hollywood Fitness apart from its competitors. Such as "Locally owned for 30 years.  Open 24 hours a day and has affordable rates. Clean and professional gym with free parking. Also would touch on the fact that the gym isn't crowded and it is a fun place to be."</p>

		<p>As you are scrolling down the homepage, we would highlight even more what the gym offers and what sets it apart from the other gyms here in Portland. The homepage would also hold reviews from happy members who are excited about their progress and the Hollywood Fitness community. Towards the bottom of the homepage, we would include a section that would be a clear call to action discussing the services and rates with a quick sign up for a basic or premium membership.</p>

		<p>We also decided to include a "get more information form" on the homepage to really get people involved without having to dig throughout the website to get more information. Lastly, the homepage would include a map of the current location of The Hollywood Fitness gym to help new members find the gym with ease. In the footer of all the pages we felt that it is important to include useful information such as Hours, Address, Phone Number, Email and social media icons to easily connect members with all that is happening with the gym.</p>

		<p>The rest of the website would remain similar to the current website with minor changes in structuring and re organization of the content. With these changes and restructuring of content, we believe that the redesign would be extremely successful and would increase website traffic for new members and would encourage current members to visit the site more frequently.</p>
